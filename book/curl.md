# The cURL project

![curl logo](curl-logo.jpg)

A funny detail about Open Source projects is that they are called "projects",
as if they were somehow limited in time or ever can get done. The cURL
"project" is a number of loosely-coupled individual volunteers working on
writing software together with a common mission: to do reliable data transfers
with Internet protocols. And giving away the code for free for anyone to use.
